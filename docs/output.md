# salzmanlab/compactors: Output Files

- `compactor.fasta`
  - FASTA file of compactor sequences
- `compactors/`
  - Intermediate compactor and spindle files generated per FASTQ file
- `compactor_summary.tsv`
  - Summary file for all compactor sequences in all FASTQ files
- `intermediary/`
  - Intermediate files generated per FASTQ file, containing reads in which anchors were found
- `logs/`
  - Log files
- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
- `sample_specificity.tsv`
  - Counts matrix of anchor-compactor by FASTQ file
- `spindles.fasta`
  - FASTA file of spindle sequences


[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
